# `Aurelia custom element <au-input-currency>`

**\<au-input-currency ...>** is a custom element for providing a UI for inputting/editing a currency amount similar in function to the HTML element **\<input type="text" ...>** except for obvious refinements such as filtering keystrokes for valid numeric input.

The Aurelia implementation is provided by the following view and view-model pair of files.
```
au-input-currency.html
au-input-currency.ts
```
the implementation requires and includes the following Aurelia converter.
```
au-currency-converter.ts
```

These files are included in the context of this project which is a demo of their use. You can see the interactive GitHub Page for this demo at [**\<au-input-currency> Demo**](https://bb-harlan.github.io/au-input-currency/).
